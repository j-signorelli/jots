Known bugs:


- Note that Instantiating coefficients every iteration is actually remarkably slow. We probably need to use FunctionCoefficients and figure out how to set in time appropriately
- We need to understand exactly what is being recommended in the Github discussion bookmarked:
	- Mmat is created from FormSystemMatrix, which eliminates essential DOFs from M from bilinear form and saves it in M_e (where M and M_e are private member variables of bilinear form)
	- Kmat is created from FormSystemMatrix, which eliminates essential DOFs from M from bilinear form and saves it in M_e (where M and M_e are private member variables of bilinear form)
	- u is the primal vector, without any applied essential BCs - so are only rows and not columns removed from Kmat? --> Must be!
	- Then see the Github for z, which is this eliminated essential BC matrix times u. As per the Github, this is not what we want. I can dig deeper into this tomorrow.
	- 

When there are essential boundary conditions, what is the Width() and Height() of the 
  formed system matrix compared with the bilinear operator? Because then they multiply it by u which is including of essential BCs.
- We don't want to copy + paste stuff from FormLinearSystem because that is way too ungeneral. I want to note: I have not tested this yet though.


- Update so that all boundary stuff is in JOTSDriver?
- Move instantiations to Config object - keeps checks out of JOTSDriver (ODESolver type) and Config (important for numerical settings)
